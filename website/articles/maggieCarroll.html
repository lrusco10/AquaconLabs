                    Her research examines muskellunge and walleye population structure in the St. Lawrence River and Eastern Lake Ontario.In these photos, Maggie and the team are working on a RADseq library prep to sequence DNA from their study organisms work that will form the foundation for future population analyses.

                <p>
                    Understanding the population structure of muskellunge and walleye is crucial for effective fisheries management and conservation efforts. By analyzing genetic data, Maggie's research aims to provide insights into the diversity and connectivity of these fish populations, which can inform strategies to maintain healthy ecosystems and sustainable fishing practices.

                    "In these pictures, we were working on a RADseq library prep to sequence DNA from our study organisms. This will give us a foundation for population analyses down the line."
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The use of RADseq technology allows for high-resolution genetic analysis, enabling researchers to identify distinct populations and assess their genetic health. This information is vital for making informed decisions about habitat protection, stocking programs, and fishing regulations to ensure the long-term viability of muskellunge and walleye populations in the region.
