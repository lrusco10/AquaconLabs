                    Earlier this month, an angler fishing on Lake Erie made a remarkable catch: a GOLDEN-colored walleye. Unlike the typical olive-green hue of most walleyes, this fish displayed a bright golden-yellow coloration that immediately caught attention. While the unusual appearance may look surprising, biologists note that it’s likely the result of genetic-based pigment change**, similar to albinism or other color mutations occasionally seen in wildlife.

                    Rare catches like this serve as a reminder of the incredible diversity found within New York’s waters, and the many discoveries that await anglers and researchers alike.
