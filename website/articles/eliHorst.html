                    Eli Horst is a senior undergraduate student at SUNY Oswego who is working on a project that will aid researchers for decades to come: an effective method for quickly determining the sex of Lake Ontario Chinook Salmon.

                    Eli's studies require him to venture into the field and discover all the varieties of Chinook Salmon the lake has to offer. In catching these specimen, Eli examines their physical characteristics and bone structure for any features unique to either males or females.

                <p>
                    Chinook Salmon, an endangered species of Lake Ontario, are a wonder among many North American freshwater specimen. As such, their preservation calls for careful observation and diligent analysis of their populations. During surveys, having a swift and accurate method of determining the sex of each specimen makes researching (and by proxy, protecting) this species worlds easier.

                <p>
                    Eli is working quickly and diligently toward several points of identification, many of which tend to lead astray.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "We have been trying to identify/develop a reliable genetic marker for determining sex in Lake Ontario Chinook salmon. We have tested 4 markers previously used on the West Coast, but have not been successful as of yet here in Lake Ontario."
                </p>

                <p>
                    Eli will continue his research into the fall, to which many other enthusiastic researchers await his results for the coming ecological surveys of Lake Ontario.
